After removing the duplicates of hard links to myfile11.txt, the stat info of the kept hard link shows the inode
number and the number of hard links associated with the file. The inode is a unique identifier for the file within
the file system, and the number of hard links indicates how many directory entries refer to the same inode. If there
were any duplicates of hard links to myfile11.txt, they have been removed, and the stat info reflects the updated
state of the file.
