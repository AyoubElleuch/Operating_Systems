Ideally, the program runtime should be increasing when the number of used threads is increasing slightly. However, when the number of threads increases substantially we should
see an increasing runtime. This is due to the mutex locking which forces the threads to wait more time for the unlocking to be done. When our program have a significan amount of
mutex calls, the runtime slows drastically.
